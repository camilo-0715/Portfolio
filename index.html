						<h2>About me</h2>
					</header>
					<div id="intro-paragraph">
						<p>My name is Juan Camilo Carmona Sanchez, a passionate robotics engineer committed to exploring the intriguing concept of transhumanism. With a solid foundation from my time at King Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain, where I graduated with honors, I've embarked on a remarkable odyssey into the world of robotics and technology.</p>
						<p>Since childhood, I aspired to be an engineer, but it was during my formative teenage years that I stumbled upon the captivating realm of robotics. As I delved into programming, I eagerly participated in various robotics events and competitions, discovering my deep fascination for both robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="extra-paragraphs" style="display: none;">
						<p>My life's journey has led me to diverse corners of the world, including Colombia, China, the Canary Islands, and Madrid. These experiences have not only enriched my knowledge but also fostered my adaptability in diverse environments, a skill I consider invaluable.</p>
						<p>Beyond my engineering prowess, I am a passionate advocate for transhumanism, envisioning a world where humans and technology coexist symbiotically. My heart lies in the field of biorobotics, where I am particularly intrigued by implants, exoskeletons, and all forms of robotics technology that bridge the gap between humanity and technology.</p>
						<p>I am committed to contributing to the creation of a world where humans and technology harmoniously merge, enhancing our capabilities and improving the human condition. Join me on this extraordinary journey where we explore the limitless potential of human-technology symbiosis.</p>
						<p>Currently, I work as a robotics engineer at Sphaira in Berlin, Germany. My role at the company involves designing, programmed and building autonomous vehicles for intrahospital transportation of both humans and goods.
